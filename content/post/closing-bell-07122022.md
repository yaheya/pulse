Yet another red day - VERY red day I should add. All eyes are on tomorrow's CPI report. I think market is pricing in a very bad news. I can't believe Powell fooled us stating "Inflation is transitory". What happened to the "transition"? It feels like the inflation is here to stay. 

TSLA had a brutal day, although at the near closing of market it recovered most of the loss which is good. Day traders are in this market like a hawk. They are making money on the massive volatility. Can't say I can blame them. 

NIO recovered a tiny bit from last couple of days sell off. Chinese Covid fear causing massive FUD. VIX is up almost 10 percent in the last two days.

Crypto appears to be stuck on Crypto winter. I have read the bottom should be in Q3 of 2022 with Q4 a bull run. Prediction S&P ends the year between 4700-4900. 


**Strategy**

* Look for signs of market bottoming, which may have already happened.
* Watch for inflation flatten up
