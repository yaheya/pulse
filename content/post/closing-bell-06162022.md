TSLA (Tesla) is currently in the downtrend. Although yesterday the stock had a decent day. As of writing this post, Nasdaq is down 4.47 % while TSLA down 9.95 % which is almost double the loss than Nasdaq. TSLA has a support level at 650. If the stock drops below that price, we can assume in the short term TSLA can revisit 600 level.

My prediction for the stock tomorrow 6/17/2022 is that we will see a bounce back to the positive.

**Strategy** : Look for short term gains; hold on to the long term securities.
