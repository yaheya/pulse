As predicted market ended up closing green - somewhat!. Nasdaq which had taken the worst beating yesterday went up the highest. However, after a brutal day yesterday, one should expect a very green day - that was not the case. DJI essentially closed flat while S&P marginally up. I follow VLO which had a nice run and dropped a bit in the past few weeks.

Crypto currency is certainly experiencing crypto winter. ETH, BTC is down 50 percent or above from their all time highs. The Cryptos I follow are the following - 

* ETH
* ADAUS
* Doge

I am hopeful ETH will have nice bounce back around September of this year. 

**Predictions** : I think Tuesday 6/21/2022 (6/20/2022 market closed) will be a very green day. With Nasdaq up at least 2 percent. 

**News** : Possibility of Ukraine joining Nato.

**Strategy** : Look for short term gains; hold on to the long term securities. Same as before, add crypto into the mix for long term holdings.
