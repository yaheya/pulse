After many years, moved my personal site to Hugo, previously DotNet Core Azure Web App. Details of current site can be found <a href="/about/">here</a>

<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which is the main platform this site runs under is a brilliant idea. Not all sites, needs to be generated off from a Database or need backend server technology. </p>
