I downloaded the Bing [wallpaper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-wallpaper?pc=W016&gclid=CjwKCAjw-8qVBhANEiwAfjXLrs0lbnSDb49ufCoyZPgW1J5XaEwN6n65MOUb7XTVzkHckVbkQWV8AxoC8a4QAvD_BwE) app. It is actually amazing, everyday I turn on my computer to see what kind of wall paper I get for that day. Most of these are amazing! I use them in my desktop and also as my zoom background! Finally, I created a small [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/) routine, that downloads each day Bing wall paper and saves it on to my drive. 

I wanted to share some of these [Bing](https://www.yaheya.com/gallery) images with you! Feel free to download them and use them as you see fit. 

In the future, I will post some of the cool things you can do with Power Automate here. Including RPA (Robotic Process Automation).

Stay tuned and enjoy!!
