Well I am happy to report my prediction for the day of the market was absolutely wrong. All major indices were massively green for the day. Solid gains in S&P, Dow and Nasdaq - what a relief.

**Weekly Summary**

* Dow - Up 4.73%
* Nasdaq Up 7.36%
* S&P Up 5.76%
* Russel 2K 4.92%
* VIX Down 16.75%

The above weekly summary is not something to pass by. We definitely see a market rebound. So does this mean the market had bottom, and we can expect a steady gains from here? I am not certain. There are still many market uncertainty out there. Not to mention wide spread FUD. Although VIX shows promise with less than 27. 

**Prediction for 06/27/2022** :

After having a lackluster week, it is possible we will see some pull back the week of 6/27/2022. However, I was recently proven wrong so I am not hundred percent sure that it will be a downturn market. Recently growth stocks are showing signs of recovery and I certainly hope it will continue. Best wishes to everyone!

NIO had a magnificent week with 21.74% up! That is massive gain. I truly believe this stock is about to hit the sky. I reiterate my price target for NIO 30 by the end of 2022. And 70 plus by 2025.

TSLA stock gained as well. Weekly gain of 14.91%. The gain isn't big as Nio yet but, not bad at all.

**Strategy** :

* I predict all indexes will end up green in 2022.
* Tax losses!
* Focus on long term growth
* NIO price target by end of 2025 - $70 (minimum)
