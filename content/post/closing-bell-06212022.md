A Very green day and what a relief! All indexes are showing solid gains. The million dollar question is - the gain is here to stay?

VIX which measures public sentiment; remains high. In my opinion, VIX >= 28 indicates high FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt). Recession fear looms. No doubt, small/large recession is forth coming. Today definitely not a good day to buy anything, as we should watch and monitor the market tomorrow. I certainly hope the gain retains.

Massive losses on Crypto appears to be on pause and yes that is a relief. I believe ETH at one time went down to 890 which is a massive discount for anyone who has the dry powder (cash)
to get on ETH. I certainly wish I did.

Finally, TSLA is showing a strong day. After weeks of massive downtrend, the stock is gaining some long awaited steam. Elon Musk clarifies company's layoff plans. Musk said the company will lay off 3.5% of the workforce, calling the amount “not super material.”

Palantir Technologies — Shares surged more than 7% after Bank of America initiated coverage of the defense tech company with a buy rating. The firm said investors are underestimating the demand for artificial intelligence that should boost Palantir’s stock.

**Predictions** : I think Wednesday 6/22/2022 will be red. The question is how red!

**News** : [BOFA says next bull market is just months away!](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/based-on-history-the-next-bull-market-is-just-months-away-and-could-take-the-s-p-500-to-6000-says-bofa-11655475414)

**Strategy** : (No Change) Look for short term gains; hold on to the long term securities. Same as before, add crypto into the mix for long term holdings.
