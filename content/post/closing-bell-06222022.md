NO SURPRISE! Red day, although mid trading day all indexes were green but gave up all the gains by the closing bell. I am glad at least, the down turn is small essentially flat. VIX decreased, which is good. Ideally, we want to see it below 20. We have a long way to go up there!

Tesla gave up all the mid day gain, at the time of writing this post, down marginally 4.89.

USWS is getting bought by Profrac at about 1.21 / stock or 0.561 exchange. The stock saw a 37% increase!

NVAX showed some strength, still way down from it's recent highs. I think NVAX going back to above 100 is not happening anytime soon despite various good news for the company.

* Start looking at tax losses!
