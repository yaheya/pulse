What a turn of events. Dow up 350 plus in the early trading, only to close -216 at the closing. All major indices gave up their gains and went into solid red. VIX edged up almost 5 percent. At the time of writing this post, all indices futures are flat. 

Earning season is upon us. Netflix investors brace for subscriber losses as company works on long-term fixes. Tesla gets a new Buy rating, and the stock rallied in the early morning. Unfortunately, gave up all the gains by the end of day.

**Strategy**

* Look for signs of market bottoming, which may have already happened.
* Watch for inflation flatten up
