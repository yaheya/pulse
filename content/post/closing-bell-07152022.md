I have taken few days break from writing my closing bell summary. Many things have happened in the last few days, unfortunately market taking a turn for the worst. All indices were mostly negative. 

Today, there is much needed market rally with all indices in solid green territory and also VIX dropping below 25. Vix well below 28. 

Here is a to a Market Bull run in 3/4 quarter of 2022!


**Strategy**

* Look for signs of market bottoming, which may have already happened.
* Watch for inflation flatten up
