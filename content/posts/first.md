This is my personal space. The focus of this site is to publish a variety of miscellaneous items that I hope visitors find interesting or useful. As I come across interesting stuff, I'll post my reflections here. What qualifies as "interesting" for me? Well, that's a pretty broad range of topics! First and foremost, I'm always interested in improving efficiency and expanding services through better utilization of technology. This is a journey, not a destination. As we implement new technologies, I'll share our successes (or failures) here.

Another topic might be if I run into a technical problem, and then find a nice solution for it. I might learn about an application or piece of hardware that offers helpful features. Maybe there's an upcoming tech-related event that's of interest. I also might come across a good magazine article. The only thing for sure is that no matter what I write about, it will be related to technology in one way or another.

Anyway, feel free to wander. If you so desire, do not hesitate to contact me. Needless to say, anything I post in this site is my personal opinion and not that of my employer.
